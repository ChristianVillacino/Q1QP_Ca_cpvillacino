                    FC 24 is a football video game where players can control any football player one at a time. They come from different teams, and they have different strengths that players must take advantage of to win.

                    We chose this topic because we wanted to help tha players. Scoring is very important in football so learning the shooting ability of the characters will help the players in choosing which character to switch when in front of the goal. We also took into consideration the versatility of the characters in different roles because if the character can shoot skillfully but is slow or can't defened the ball, then it will be easily stolen from them. The variables we chose include the footballersâ€™ teams, field positions, shooting skills, and overall capability.

                    The game contains about twenty thousand characters so we decided to just pick the minimum number of characters required. Therefore, due to a small number of sample, conclusions derived will be limited and can be inaccurate.
