                Our team found out that most of the players are skilled at shooting and have a high OVR value. This means that aside from attacking, they also have the ability to defend themselves and prevent the ball from getting stolen. Most of the players in our data have a versatile playstyle and can adapt to difficult situations well. We also found out that the best shooters are the strikers. According to one of our teammates who plays FC 24, it's because they're trained to score the goals. Players must still be careful when picking characters because we found an outlier in our data and they have the lowest SHO. They might not be good to use in shooting, but they also have other skills that are useful. Remember that in FC 24, you are playing as one whole team that consists of plenty of people.
